# Berkeley College System

  
In this coursewor, the database system has been developed and designed for a hypothetical college, Berkeley college. According to the case study, the college requires the development of a web-based system capable of performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions, as well as a manual to assist users in properly using the system. To do this, the Oracle database and ASP.NET Web Core, as well as other required tools such as SQL Developer, Data Modeler, and Visual Studio IDE, were chosen and integrated into the system's development.
